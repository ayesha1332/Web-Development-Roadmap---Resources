## 📌 What is Web Development?

Web development is the process of **creating, maintaining, and optimizing websites and web applications**. It involves multiple layers:

- **Frontend Development** – Everything users see and interact with, including layout, styling, and user experience.  
- **Backend Development** – Server-side logic, database management, authentication, and APIs that power applications.  
- **Full-Stack Development** – Combines both frontend and backend skills, enabling you to develop complete web applications independently.

Web development is highly in-demand and constantly evolving, making it a valuable skill for careers in tech.
